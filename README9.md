**Aim:** “To load and explore data in R using tibbles, perform descriptive analysis, fit a linear regression model, visualize the regression line, and evaluate model performance using statistical metrics such as R-squared and p-values.”  
Load the libraries you will need in R programming  
a)Load the data as a tibble (readr has a function that does this directly)  
b)Get the descriptives for your data so you can understand what you're dealing with a little better   
c) Explore the data and see if there are any interesting trends to consider   
d) Define the linear model   
e) Plot the regression line   
f) Print the results of the model   
g) How many observations was the regression run on?   
h) What is the R-squared of this regression? What does it tell you?  
i) Determine if size is a statistically significant predictor of price.   
j) What is the regression equation associated with this regression model?
